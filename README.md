# Mad Grid
 
Mad Grid is a visual sequence memory game originally inspired by Human Benchmark. The game consists of a 2×2 grid, which displays a randomly generated sequence to be perfectly replicated by the user. The game becomes progressively more difficult as the length of the sequence increments in each level.

Features
Mad Grid consists of three game modes:

Classic: the sequence simply increments by one following the successful completion of each level.
Reverse: similar to Classic mode, but the user is required to replicate the sequence in reverse order.
Messy: similar to Classic mode, but an entirely new sequence is generated following the successful completion of each level.
Additional features include:

Guide page providing interactive tutorials and text descriptions
Adjustable sequence display speed (1.0×, 1.5×, 2.0×, 2.5×).
