## Gameplay Mechanics
The core of Mad Grid revolves around a 2x2 grid that displays a sequence of randomly highlighted shapes. The objective? The player must replicate this sequence perfectly. But it's not as simple as it sounds. The game increases in difficulty as you advance, with the length of the sequence growing with each successfully completed level.

## Game Modes
Mad Grid offers three unique modes to test your memory skills:

**Classic Mode**: After successfully completing each level, the sequence extends by one.
**Reverse Mode**: Here's a twist - replicate the sequence in reverse order!
**Messy Mode**: Every new level greets you with a completely different sequence.

## Extra Features
For a more personalized gaming experience, Mad Grid is loaded with additional features:

A guide page offering interactive tutorials and text descriptions to help you get started.
Adjustable sequence display speeds (1.0x, 1.5x, 2.0x, 2.5x), to modify the game according to your pace.
We also offer stock information lookup, powered by Yahoo Finance API.

## Adaptive Difficulty
Regardless of your skill level, Mad Grid is designed for you. The grid dimensions and the number of highlighted shapes per turn adjust based on your selected level of difficulty, making the game progressively challenging.
